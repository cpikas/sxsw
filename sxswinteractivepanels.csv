However, few provide a methodology for determining the nature of the challenge and design for an effective solution. A Gamification pioneer and International keynote speaker, Yu-Kai Chou presents a systematic approach to implement effective gameful design for any process. Using an actionable gamification approach, the elements of human motivation become the salient factors in the design process. Instead of focusing on game elements like points, badges, and leaderboards, Yu-kai will break down motivation into the eight Core Drives that inspire people to engage and learn through game techniques."

Despite the right to health, few countries ensure that all immigrants receive the same healthcare as citizens. Although immigrants are typically younger and healthier than citizens and often bear the burden of caretaking for citizens and their families, many citizens blame immigrants for their health problems.  In turn, nations create exclusionary policies that discriminate against newcomers.  Sometimes rich nations have shaped the conditions that drive the global poor to leave their native countries.  But one person’s health can affect the health of others and good health can benefit many.  Given the public dimensions of health, failure to help newcomers in need of care is not only counterproductive because it puts the health of all at risk, but it also violates basic principles of fairness, reciprocity and justice.  Health for all requires solidarity with others."

As these tools develop to understand more of our intuitive human knowledge, they will have the ability to become intelligent collaborators in our creative process.  How will the objects and activities of design change in this future?  Through exploring how objects ‘work’, this talk considers how an acute understanding of this design language can make us better designers and help to develop more intuitive computational design tools that provoke and democratize a ‘new’ industrial design process."

But the shift from screens to voice unlocks a new set of concerns for personalization, distinct from Netflix's recommendations or Google's filter bubbles. As advances in natural language understanding and affective computing take hold, assistants will rely on a vast, textured data set of choices, memories and desires in the past to condition our lives in the future. How can we navigate this tradeoff between personalization and emotional growth, and design successful personal assistants that still leave space for the user to grow, change and forget?"

The Governments of various Caribbean islands are looking to innovate and are setting up programs and handing out grants to attract startups and tech companies. They are working on policies and looking into closing partnerships to stimulate this. A group of ambassadors from varius islands of the Caribbean are living proof that the Caribbean is up and coming and shouldn’t be overlooked anymore. 
Everything ATECH does evolves around the creation of a local startup tech sector and promoting Aruba and the Caribbean as a global tech hub. A place where global startups, and both local and international entrepreneurs, can build companies, test new concepts and receive guidance and funding. Further, a thriving entrepreneurial sector initially catalyzed by the private sector will have a strong foundation as it limits bureaucracy and politics. The government’s role should be one of a facilitator. 
Technological innovation is a powerful source of productivity and growth, especially when bourne by startups. 
Why now?
We have witnessed firsthand the birth of a mini revolution, where young entrepreneurs have decided to take action instead of relying on the government or other established institutions to facilitate an innovative initiative. This phenomenon is rare in Aruban and Caribbean culture. There is great momentum and this creative energy needs to be fueled to drive the machine forward and build a community of entrepreneurs that TRUST that we have their best interests at heart.
The future of our economy is going to depend on our teachings and facilitating our young people to build companies, export and encouraging them to pay it forward by teaching and helping their younger peers. 
A startup tech ecosystem has the potential to contribute to the GDP of the Caribbean economy, create new and exciting jobs, limit brain drain, stimulate established companies to be creative and innovative, to collaborate with young entrepreneurs, and products and services for export. All this and we have yet taken into account the spin-off effect it will have."

Because we have real problems, the only way to solve them is by ourselves. More people in Africa have a phone than access to electricity (500m), but so to do 1.5bn people globally. These are the same problems the world is facing, so when we solve them, we do it for everyone. Africa's innovative spirit has produced mobile payments like M-Pesa (through which 40% of Kenya's GDP is transacted) and other ground-breaking innovations like M-Kopa, WeFarm and BRCK. We Africans are world leaders in frugal innovation. Africa is not just mobile-first, it is a mobile-only continent."
